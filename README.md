# DBUI-demo

A website for employees who go on business lunches to be able to request reimbursements for the expenses. Financials are the ones who approve/deny requests and are the main financial team people (treasurers, etc.), while all other employees of a company are the ones who submit claims. The CEO has ultimate authority over everything.
